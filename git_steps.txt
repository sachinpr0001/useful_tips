                        INITIAL STEPS TO LINK GITHUB TO YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM

git --version
git config --global user.name "USERNAME"        #one time only
git config --global user.email"EMAIL ADDRESS"   #one time only

                                STEPS TO CHECK THE LINK
                                
git config --list                               #to check the list of configurations you entered
ls -al                                          #to list all the files in your local system                 
gedit .gitconfig                                #to edit the file that has stored all your entered configurations

                   STEPS TO CREATE A DIRECTORY FOR YOUR WORK AND SYNC TO GITHUB

mkdir name_of_directory                         #to create a directory
cd name_of_directory                            #to enter that directory
git clone paste.theurlhere                      #to clone your GitHub repository to your local system
ls                                              #to check if the files from GitHub have been cloned here or not
touch create_a_file.extension                   #to create a file in your local system to edit (and later push)
ls                                              #to check that created file
gedit create_a_file.extension                   #to edit that created file
git status                                      #to check the status of sync of that created file with GitHub
git add <filename.extension>                    #to add that file to commit
git status                                      #to check the status again
git commit -m "comments" filename.extention     #to commit that file to GitHub
git push -u -u origin master                    #to push that file to your GitHub repository
<enter your GitHub username>                    #prompted task
<enter your GitHub password>                    #prompted task

                       STEPS TO SYNC THE CHANGES YOU MADE IN YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY TO YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM
           
git fetch origin master                         #to fetch the changes from your GitHub repository
git merge origin master                         #to merge those changes to your local system
