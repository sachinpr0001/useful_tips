                        INITIAL STEPS TO LINK GITHUB TO YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM

git --version
git config --global user.name "USERNAME"        #one time only
git config --global user.email"EMAIL ADDRESS"   #one time only

                                STEPS TO CHECK THE LINK
                                
git config --list                               #to check the list of configurations you entered
ls -al                                          #to list all the files in your local system                 
gedit .gitconfig                                #to edit the file that has stored all your entered configurations

                   STEPS TO CREATE A DIRECTORY FOR YOUR WORK AND SYNC TO GITHUB

mkdir name_of_directory                         #to create a directory
cd name_of_directory                            #to enter that directory
git clone paste.theurlhere                      #to clone your GitHub repository to your local system
ls                                              #to check if the files from GitHub have been cloned here or not
touch create_a_file.extension                   #to create a file in your local system to edit (and later push)
ls                                              #to check that created file
gedit create_a_file.extension                   #to edit that created file
git status                                      #to check the status of sync of that created file with GitHub
git add <filename.extension>                    #to add that file to commit
git status                                      #to check the status again
git commit -m "comments" filename.extention     #to commit that file to GitHub
git push -u -u origin master                    #to push that file to your GitHub repository
<enter your GitHub username>                    #prompted task
<enter your GitHub password>                    #prompted task

                       STEPS TO SYNC THE CHANGES YOU MADE IN YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY TO YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM
           
git fetch origin master                         #to fetch the changes from your GitHub repository
git merge origin master                         #to merge those changes to your local system


			STEPS TO WORK ON SOMEONE ELSE'S REPOSITORY AND PUSH YOUR CHANGES TO IT

1. Fork your friend's repository.
2. Fire up your terminal and type: git clone {URL}.
3. Use this command to create a branch: git checkout -b new_branch.
4. Create a new remote for the upstream repo i.e. the link of original repo with the command: git remote add upstream {URL}
5. Do whatever changes you want in your local machine.
6. Fire up your terminal again and type git add {file name} or git add . if you want to add all files.
7. Then type a message git commit -m "message"
8. Create a branch: git remote add upstream {URL of friend's repository that you have forked}
9. For confirmation: git remote -v
10. git push --set-upstream origin new_branch
11. Go to your GitHub webpage and create a pull request for your commit.
